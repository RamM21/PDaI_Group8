2D Platform jumping game 

This project was made for Unity and we used ready-made assets in the work. 

What game included:

Ui - Start Menu, Game Over, End Screen, Options, Volome Button and Healtbar.
Level System - Level 1 and Level 2. 
Player - Hero Knight. 
Enemies - six different types of enemies.
Traps - six different types of traps.
Collectibles - three different types of collectibles, one of which gives health and the other gives damage bonus.
Effects - etc. pass the level and the effect will occur.
Checkpoints - if the player dies, it spawns to the nearest checkpoint that it has opened.
Musics - the player has her own sounds as well as enemies, traps and the background.

The game is designed for a player who jumps, collects collectibles and kills enemies by swinging a sword
while dodging various traps and trying to survive to the finish line.
If the player dies or falling downform the map in the game, she can either try again and the character will spawn at the checkpoint,
if she has activated such before the game ended or the game starts from the beginning of the level.
